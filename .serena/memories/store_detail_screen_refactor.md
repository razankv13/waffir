Store detail screen (lib/features/stores/presentation/screens/store_detail_screen/) was refactored to use a StoreDetailUiController (StateNotifier) plus modular widgets under the widgets/ subfolder (view, info sections, engagement sections, CTA, not-found). The main screen is now a ConsumerWidget that seeds controller state from storeByIdProvider and passes callbacks down to the new widgets.
